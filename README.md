# ðŸ”’Phishing URL Detection

## Overview

This project demonstrates a phishing detection system using a trained machine learning model served via a Flask web application. Users can input a URL and get real-time predictions of whether it's legitimate or phishing, along with confidence percentages.

## Live Demo

Access the live app here:  
[Phishing URL Detector](https://phishing-url-detector-kn1b.onrender.com)  
( **Note**: It may take upto a minute to load for the first time)

## Key Features

- Trained scikit-learn pipeline with TF-IDF (word and character level) and LinearSVC
- Calibrated model outputs for accurate probability estimates
- Flask web app to interact with the model via a browser
- Dynamic visual feedback using progress bars for prediction confidence
- Render or GitHub-compatible for deployment

## Dataset and Model

- Based on the following dataset of URLs labeled as legitimate or phishing:
   - `https://huggingface.co/datasets/pirocheto/phishing-url`
- Pipeline includes:
  - TF-IDF feature extraction (word and character)
  - Linear Support Vector Machine with calibration for probabilities
- Model is saved as a pickle file and loaded at runtime
